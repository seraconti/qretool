"""Render-local helpers for WithinCalibrationPanel: functions of axes and theme only.

Nothing here derives a SCIENTIFIC quantity or writes into the artifact. These are
view-only functions of already-computed arrays: decade guides, bin geometry, the
observed-stretch slicing, and the claim-discipline annotation. Every verdict the
annotation states (whether a peak is symmetric, whether pooling is too thin) is a flag
computed in the analyzer band and handed here already decided. They do arithmetic - `adaptive_ylim` takes
`observed_slices` searches for cut indices - but only to decide where to put
ink, which CLAUDE.md places on the renderer's side of the line. Every value they read
was computed by _within_calibration_compute and lives in the artifact.

Kept out of within_calibration.py so the renderer file is the drawing sequence and this
file is the arithmetic that drawing needs.
