    """A file to read, plus what is needed to interpret it.

    `extra` and `loader_kwargs` are BOTH free-form dicts and it matters which one a key
    goes in. `extra` is run metadata: it survives into `Norm["meta"]` and reaches
    provenance. `loader_kwargs` is passed to the reader for this file's extension and is
    never read back.

    Merging them is a defect rather than a simplification: one field would be forwarded to
    the loader AND read back as metadata, so `extra={'run_start_unix_s': ...}` - the value
    `_load_dataset`'s own error message tells you to set - would reach
    `pd.read_csv(path, **extra)` and raised `unexpected keyword argument`. It only ever
    worked because every in-repo caller used `.pickle`, whose loader discards the dict.
