"""Render-local helpers for CheckLedgerPanel: functions of axes and theme only.

Nothing here decides a verdict or derives a statistic. Every cell's colour comes from a
verdict string that `analyzers/check_ledger.py` already resolved, and every number is read
from the ledger frame as-is. These functions only work out where to put ink: which rows to
show, how to shorten a label to fit a cell, and how to lay the table out.

Kept out of `panels/check_ledger.py` so that file is the drawing sequence and this one is
the arithmetic the drawing needs.
