"""T2* within-calibration job for 070423_6D2S_qubit1 - carved from observed reads only.

One of the two members of the `t2star` family. The graph is
`quebra.recipes.configure_t2star_job`; what is here is this run's parameter row, which is
the part worth diffing against its sibling. Everything shared lives in the recipe: the two
files are byte-identical once the date and the run duration are normalised.
