"""What the calibration bench established, as four figures.

This job is the one place the bench's numbers reach a figure, and it does so WITHOUT
importing `bench/`. The two result tables are declared as `Dataset`s and loaded with
`job.load_df`, so their sha256 lands in `dataset_hashes` and in the run identity: the
figures cannot silently be built against a different bench, and
`tests/test_bench_isolation.py` still holds because the dependency runs through provenance
rather than through the import graph.

`jobs/bench/results/*.csv` is inside the repository, not under the dataset root, which is why
`core.paths.resolve_dataset_path` grows a repo-root fallback - see its docstring.

The fourth figure re-simulates rather than reshaping a table: a P-P plot needs the
statistics themselves and the tables carry only rejection rates. Its `seed` and replicate
count are step kwargs, so both appear on the provenance label and the figure is
reproducible from the record alone.
