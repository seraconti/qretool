"""`tlf`'s dwell statistics against the SAMPLED two-state law, not its continuous limit.

Oracle: a two-state chain observed on a read grid. Sampled at spacing `dt`, a state left
with per-read probability `p` has run lengths exactly Geometric(p) on {1, 2, ...}. `tlf.run`
measures dwells on the ASSIGNED READ SEQUENCE - `tlf.py` run-length encodes the per-read
state assignment and multiplies by the median read spacing - so the quantities it reports
converge to

    mean dwell -> dt / p            dwell CV -> sqrt(1 - p)

and NOT to the continuous-time `1/lambda` and `CV = 1`. Those are the `dt -> 0` limits of the
same quantities and they are measurably different here: state 0's sampled mean is 6.67 read
intervals against a continuous 6.15, and its sampled CV is 0.922 against 1.0. An earlier
draft of `spec/spectests06.md` asserted the continuous values; it was wrong, and the
assertions below are written so that version of the test would fail.

**The two rates are deliberately UNEQUAL, and an earlier version of this file was symmetric.**
Under `lambda = mu` the two states have identical dwell laws, so every assertion held whichever
label the mixture happened to assign - inverting `tlf.py`'s label map left the ENTIRE suite at
585 passed, measured. A test that cannot fail when the map it names is inverted is the defect
class this phase exists to remove. With `p01 != p10` the states carry different means (6.67
against 2.22 read intervals) and a swapped map fails immediately.

`switching_rate_per_hour` still has a closed form under asymmetry: the stationary transition
rate is `2 * p01 * p10 / (p01 + p10)` per read. It is asserted, and labelled a consistency
check rather than independent evidence, because it is a function of the same two parameters.

**Restriction, stated rather than hidden.** The draw is noise-free two-level, because
`tlf.run` assigns state by a per-read MAP on the value alone: one misassigned read splits a
true run into three, so the oracle needs misassignment far below `p01`. With measurement
noise there is no closed form and this stops being simulation truth. In that configuration
the Gaussian mixture degenerates to a threshold and does no work, so what this test validates
is the run-length bookkeeping, the label-ordering map and the CV formula - a unit test of
`tlf.py`'s dwell path, not a validation of mixture-based state assignment. Said plainly so
the tier it earns is not overstated.
